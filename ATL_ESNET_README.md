# ATL ESnet - Content Pages Status

## Overview
The ATL ESnet system has been restructured so that the Employee Handbook and Legacy Blueprint sections link to individual content pages instead of PDF files. This provides a better user experience with formatted, readable content.

## What's Complete ✅

### Main Pages:
1. **index.html** - Homepage with reorganized navigation
2. **employee-handbook.html** - Hub page with links to 11 sections  
3. **legacy-blueprint.html** - Hub page with links to 6 sections

### Example Content Pages (Created):
1. **handbook-employment-practices.html** - Complete with all sections
2. **blueprint-10-5-rule.html** - Complete with 10-foot and 5-foot rules

## What Needs to Be Created 📋

### Employee Handbook Content Pages (10 remaining):
1. handbook-standards-of-conduct.html
2. handbook-compensation.html
3. handbook-benefits.html
4. handbook-time-off.html
5. handbook-safety-security.html
6. handbook-technology.html
7. handbook-drug-free.html
8. handbook-workplace-policies.html

2. blueprint-guest-experience.html
3. blueprint-communication.html
4. blueprint-make-it-happen.html

## How to Create Remaining Pages

Each content page should follow this structure:

1. **Same header/navigation as existing pages**
2. **Breadcrumb navigation**: Home > Handbook/Blueprint > Page Title
3. **Page title and subtitle**
4. **Content sections** with:
   - Section titles (h2)
   - Subsection titles (h3) where needed
   - Content text in paragraphs
   - Highlight boxes for important information
   - Bullet lists where appropriate
5. **Back button** to return to main handbook/blueprint page
6. **Same footer as other pages**

## File Naming Convention

- Employee Handbook: `handbook-[section-name].html`
- Legacy Blueprint: `blueprint-[section-name].html`

## Content Source

All content is extracted from:
- `/mnt/project/Legacy_Ventures_Hotels_Team_Member_Handbook__2025.pdf`
- `/mnt/project/Legacy_Blueprint.pdf`

## Navigation Structure

```

## Next Steps

To complete the system, create the remaining 15 content pages using the same template and styling as the two example pages that have been created. Extract content from the PDF files in the project folder and format it appropriately.
